```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
beer_mkts <- read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/beer_markets.csv')
rmarkdown::paged_table(beer_mkts)
```
Question 1. 
- For each household, calculate the number of beer transactions.
- For each household, calculate the proportion of each beer brand choice.

```{r}
q2c <- beer_mkts %>% 
  count(hh, brand) %>% 
  group_by(hh) %>% 
  mutate(n_tot = sum(n)) %>%  # n_tot : the number of beer transactions
  arrange(hh, brand) %>% 
  mutate( prop = n / n_tot ) # prop: the proportion of each beer brand choice

q2c
```

Question 2.
- For households that purchased BUD LIGHT at least once, what fraction of households did purchase only BUD LIGHT?
- For households that purchased BUSCH LIGHT at least once, what fraction of households did purchase only BUSCH LIGHT?
- For households that purchased COORS LIGHT at least once, what fraction of households did purchase only COORS LIGHT?
- For households that purchased MILLER LITE at least once, what fraction of households did purchase only MILLER LITE?
- For households that purchased NATURAL LIGHT at least once, what fraction of households did purchase only NATURAL LIGHT?
Which beer brand does have the largest proportion of such loyal consumers?
```{r}
q2b <- beer_mkts %>% 
  mutate(bud = ifelse(brand=="BUD LIGHT", 1, 0), # 1 if brand=="BUD LIGHT"; 0 otherwise
         busch = ifelse(brand=="BUSCH LIGHT", 1, 0),
         coors = ifelse(brand=="COORS LIGHT", 1, 0),
         miller = ifelse(brand=="MILLER LITE", 1, 0),
         natural = ifelse(brand=="NATURAL LIGHT", 1, 0),
         .after = hh) %>% 
  select(hh:natural) %>%  # select the variables we need
  group_by(hh) %>% 
  summarise(n_transactions = n(), # number of beer transactions for each hh
            n_bud = sum(bud), # number of BUD LIGHT transactions for each hh
            n_busch = sum(busch), 
            n_coors = sum(coors), 
            n_miller = sum(miller), 
            n_natural = sum(natural) 
  ) %>% 
  summarise(loyal_bud = sum(n_transactions == n_bud) / sum(n_bud > 0), 
              # sum(n_transactions == n_bud) : the number of households that purchased BUD LIGHT only
              # sum(n_bud > 0) : the number of households that purchased BUD LIGHT at least once.
            loyal_busch = sum(n_transactions == n_busch) / sum(n_busch > 0),
            loyal_coors = sum(n_transactions == n_coors) / sum(n_coors > 0),
            loyal_miller = sum(n_transactions == n_miller) / sum(n_miller > 0),
            loyal_natural = sum(n_transactions == n_natural) / sum(n_natural > 0)
  )
