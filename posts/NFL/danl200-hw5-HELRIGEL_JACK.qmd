# Question 2. NFL in 2022

- Add a blog post with your answers for Question 2 to your website (https://jackhelrigel.github.io/).
  - Make sure that your blog post for Question 2 includes all the questionnaires and your answers to them.
  - Make sure that your blog post for Question 2 has a section for each sub-question (e.g., Q2a, Q2b) in Question 2, so that the Table of Contents display the section for each questionnaire.
- The following is the data.frame for Question 2.

```{r}
NFL2022_stuffs <- read.csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/NFL2022_stuffs.csv')
```

- NFL2022_stuffs is the data.frame that contains information about NFL games in year 2022, in which the unit of observation is a single play for each drive in a NFL game.


# Variable Description 🏈

- play_id: Numeric play identifier that when used with game_id and drive provides the unique identifier for a single play
- game_id: Ten digit identifier for NFL game.
- drive: Numeric drive number in the game.
- week: Season week.
- posteam: String abbreviation for the team with possession.
- qtr: Quarter of the game (5 is overtime).
- half_seconds_remaining: Numeric seconds remaining in the half.
- down: The down for the given play.
  - Basically you get four attempts (aka downs) to move the ball 10 yards (by either running with it or passing it).
  - If you make 10 yards then you get another set of four downs.
- pass: Binary indicator if the play was a pass play.
- wp: Estimated winning probability for the posteam given the current situation at the start of the given play.

# Q2A

In data.frame, NFL2022_stuffs, remove observations for which values of posteam is missing.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
```

```{r}
q2a <- NFL2022_stuffs %>% 
  filter(!is.na(posteam))
```

# Q2B 

Summarize the mean value of pass for each posteam when all the following conditions hold:

1. wp is greater than 20% and less than 75%;
2. down is less than or equal to 2; and
3. half_seconds_remaining is greater than 120.


```{r}
q2b <- NFL2022_stuffs %>% 
  filter(between(wp, 0.2, 0.75),
         down <= 2,
         half_seconds_remaining > 120)

meanvalq2b <- q2b %>% 
  group_by(posteam) %>% 
  summarise(mean_pass = mean(pass, na.rm = TRUE))

meanvalq2b
```

# Q2C 

- Provide both (1) a ggplot code with geom_point() using the resulting data.frame in Q2b and (2) a simple comments to describe the mean value of pass for each posteam.
  - In the ggplot, reorder the posteam categories based on the mean value of pass in ascending or in descending order.
  
  ≈
```{r}
meanvaldesc <- meanvalq2b %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean_pass))

ggplot(meanvaldesc, aes(x = mean_pass, y = reorder(posteam, mean_pass))) +
  geom_point()+
  labs(x= "Percentage of Pass Plays",
       y= "Team with possesion")
```
Comments:
  - Cincinnati, Kansas City, Los Angeles Chargers, Buffalo Bills, and Philadelphia eagles had the top 5 highest average percentage of pass plays during the 2022 season.
  - Atlanta, Washington, Chicago, New Orleans, and Tennessee had the top 5 lowest average percentage of pass plays during the 2022 season.
  

# Q2D

- Consider the following data.frame, NFL2022_epa:

```{r}
NFL2022_epa <- read.csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/NFL2022_epa.csv')
```

- Variable description for NFL2022_epa
  - play_id: Numeric play identifier that when used with game_id and drive provides the unique identifier for a single play
  - game_id: Ten digit identifier for NFL game.
  - drive: Numeric drive number in the game.
  - posteam: String abbreviation for the team with possession.
  - passer: Name of the player who passed a ball to a receiver by initially taking a three-step drop and backpedaling into the pocket to make a pass. (Mostly, they are quarterbacks)
  - receiver: Name of the receiver.
  - epa: Expected points added (EPA) by the posteam for the given play.
- Create the data.frame, NFL2022_stuffs_EPA, that includes
  1. All the variables in the data.frame, NFL2022_stuffs;
  2. The variables, passer, receiver, and epa, from the data.frame, NFL2022_epa. by joining the two data.frames.
- In the resulting data.frame, NFL2022_stuffs_EPA, remove observations with NA in passer.

Answer: 
```{r}
NFL2022_stuffs_EPA <- left_join(NFL2022_stuffs, NFL2022_epa, by = c("play_id", "game_id", "drive", "posteam"))

NFL2022_stuffs_EPA <- NFL2022_stuffs_EPA %>%
  filter(!is.na(passer))
```

# Q2E 

- Provide both (1) a single ggplot and (2) a simple comment to describe the NFL weekly trend of weekly mean value of epa for each of the following two passers,
  1. “J.Allen”
  2. “P.Mahomes”

```{r}
two_passers <- c("J.Allen", "P.Mahomes")

filtered_twopassers <- NFL2022_stuffs_EPA %>% 
  filter(passer %in% two_passers)

mean_epa_data <- filtered_twopassers %>% group_by(week, passer) %>% 
  summarise(mean_epa = mean(epa, na.rm = TRUE))

ggplot(mean_epa_data, aes(x= week, y= mean_epa, color = passer))+
  geom_line()+
  scale_color_manual(values =c("J.Allen" ="blue", "P.Mahomes"="red"))+
  labs(x= "Week",
       y= "Mean value of expected points added (EPA)")
```
Comment: Patrick Mahomes generally had a higher mean value of epa. However, there were a few weeks that Josh Allen had a higher mean value of epa.

# Q2F

Calculate the difference between the mean value of epa for “J.Allen” the mean value of epa for “P.Mahomes” for each value of week.

```{r}
difference_epa <- mean_epa_data %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = passer, values_from = mean_epa)

difference_epa$epa_differnce <- difference_epa$'J.Allen' - difference_epa$'P.Mahomes'

print(difference_epa)
```

# Q2G

- Summarize the resulting data.frame in Q2d, with the following four variables:
  - posteam: String abbreviation for the team with possession.
  - passer: Name of the player who passed a ball to a receiver by initially taking a three-step drop, and backpedaling into the pocket to make a pass. (Mostly, they are quarterbacks.)
  - mean_epa: Mean value of epa in 2022 for each passer
  - n_pass: Number of observations for each passer
- Then find the top 10 NFL passers in 2022 in terms of the mean value of epa, conditioning that n_pass must be greater than or equal to the third quantile level of n_pass.

```{r}
summary_data <- NFL2022_stuffs_EPA %>%
  group_by(posteam, passer) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_epa = mean(epa, na.rm = TRUE),
    n_pass = n()
  )

quantile_threshold_passer <- quantile(summary_data$n_pass, 0.75)
filtered_summary_data <- summary_data %>%
  filter(n_pass >= quantile_threshold_passer)

top_10_passers <- filtered_summary_data %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_epa)) %>% 
  head(n=10)
  
top_10_passers
```
